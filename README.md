# uPower-Simulator

uPowerSimulator is the Instruction Set Simulator for the new **uPower** ISA, a subset of the **Power ISA** developed by the OpenPOWER Foundation, led by IBM.

## Preliminaries:
- The project is written entirely in C.
- There are mainly two components: The Assembler and the Simulator.
- The code uses the Linux kernel coding style (https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.10/process/coding-style.html).
